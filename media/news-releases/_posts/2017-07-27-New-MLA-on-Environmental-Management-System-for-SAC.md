The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) has signed the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) Multilateral recognition arrangements (MLA) for accreditation of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) on 27 July 2017. With the new MLA in place, SAC-accredited EMS (ISO 14001) certificates will be recognized internationally.

The purpose of the MLA is to ensure mutual recognition of accredited certification practices among the MLA signatories and acceptance of accredited certification in many markets based on a common accreditation framework. Accreditation helps to underpin the credibility and quality of goods and services. The confidence and recognition of SAC accreditation will help to facilitate the acceptance of accredited certifications and therefore ensure quality of business. With the new MLA, users can leverage an international network of certification bodies which had been recognised for their consistency and credibility across different markets.
