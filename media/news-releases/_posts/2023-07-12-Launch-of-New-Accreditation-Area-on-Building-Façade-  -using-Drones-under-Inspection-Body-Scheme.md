**Launch of New Accreditation Area on Building Façade Inspection using Drones under Inspection Body Scheme**


SAC is pleased to expand our accreditation scheme for Inspection Body to include Building Façade Inspection using Drones with effect from 12 Jul 2023.

The new accreditation area which provides assurance on the inspections carried out by competent drones service providers and inspection companies for building façade inspections, will be recognised by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) for their periodic façade inspection regime.  Usage of drones to perform various on-site operations has been observed to be on the raise across many industries. Specific to building façade inspection, drones coupled with relevant data analysis/Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could bring about benefits like higher productivity, due to the ability to capture images quickly and analyse images of façade defects, as well as improve workplace safety by reducing the need for inspectors to conduct physical inspections at high risk environments. 

Interested applicants will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17020 :2012 , the following Technical References and SAC document, under the accreditation scheme for Inspection Body:
•  TR 78 -1 - Building facade inspection using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)
•  TR 78 -2 - Specification for quality management and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
•  SAC Technical Note : FI 01 – Specific Requirements for the Accreditation of Inspection Bodies in Building Façade Inspection using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)

Application for accreditation is now open through SAC’s Accreditation Management portal, SACINET.
