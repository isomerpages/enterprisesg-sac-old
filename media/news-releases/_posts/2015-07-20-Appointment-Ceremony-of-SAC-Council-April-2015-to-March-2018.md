At the ceremony, Mr Yeo highlighted that the SAC Council plays a critical role in supporting SAC to build trust in Singapore's product and services. SAC will continuously look into new areas such as sustainability development, healthcare, safety and security, as well as the "silver" industry to ensure that our national accreditation system is responsive and relevant to support Singapore's market growth and competitiveness. The many achievements made by the SAC would not be possible without the strong support and contributions from every member of the Council and other SAC volunteers.

With the fast changing industry landscapes, there will be new challenges faced by the conformity and accreditation arena. Mr Yeo urged all members to continue their support and help in developing a robust strategic plan that can help Singapore industries understand and leverage on accreditation to gain greater competitiveness and drive greater quality awareness of Singapore products globally and internationally.
