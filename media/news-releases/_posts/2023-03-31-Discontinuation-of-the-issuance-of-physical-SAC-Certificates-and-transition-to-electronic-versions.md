*Discontinuation of the issuance of physical SAC Certificates and transition to electronic versions**

UPDATES TO THE SAC ACCREDITATION CERTIFICATES

With effect from 01 July 2023, SAC will implement the 2 changes to the current SAC Accreditation Certificate arrangements:

 

1) Transition of physical SAC Accreditation Certificates to electronic versions

Currently, SAC issues physical SAC accreditation certificates to the accredited testing, inspection and certification bodies. In alignment with the overall government efforts on digitalisation and digitisation to improve efficiency and better manage data/processes, SAC will transit to issue only electronic certificates. This change also aligns with the public service and Enterprise Singapore’s efforts to “go green” and reduce carbon footprint in our processes with the reduction of paper usage.

 

2) Amendments to the SAC Certificate format

The format and content of the certificate had been revised to better safeguard certificate authenticity and improve security of its contents. As part of the revisions, a unique QR Code, which links to specific SAC accreditation content on the specific CAB, will be added to the Certificate for ease of access to accreditation details as well as authentication purposes.
