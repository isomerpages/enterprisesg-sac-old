The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) has launched a new accreditation programme for Asset Management Certification on 12 August 2015 during the SPRING Quality and Standard Conference. 
 
This Accreditation Programme is to accredit certification bodies (CBs) certifying companies to ISO 55001: *Asset Management – Management Systems – Requirements*. ISO 55001 specifies the requirements for certifying management of assets which can be a physical infrastructure or equipment, financial, human, information as well as intangible assets (reputation, brand, patents etc.). Accredited certification provides greater assurance for the safe and reliable use of these infrastructures. Other benefits of optimised asset management include reduced risks associated with ownership of assets, mitigate potential loss of revenue and reputation, and support for international business growth.
 
CBs accredited by SAC will be assessed to meet stringent criteria of conducting good certification practices in accordance with international best practices. Asset management is critical for businesses to evaluate their asset efficiently. With globalisation, more businesses and industries are facing challenges to optimise the technical and financial performance of an asset.
 
SAC accreditation will provide added public confidence, level playing field among the CBs and assurance of integrity, credibility and transparency of certification services. In addition, SAC has a good track record of accrediting certification programmes that gain increasing acceptance from  industry and government agencies.
 
Accreditation for the Asset Management Certification programme is now open for CB’s application via [SACiNet](https://sacinet.enterprisesg.gov.sg/sac/forms/sacinet/sacinet-logon-external.form){:target="_blank"}.
