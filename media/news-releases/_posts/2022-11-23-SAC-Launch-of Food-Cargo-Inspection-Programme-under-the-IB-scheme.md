**SAC Launch of Food Cargo Inspection Programme under the IB scheme**

The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to expand the Accreditation for Inspection Body Scheme to include Food Cargo Inspection with effect from 22 November 2022.

The Food Cargo Inspection programme will be a new area under the Cargo Inspection field of the Inspection Body Scheme.

The new area of accreditation will provide assurance that the inspection of Food Cargo such as Agriculture and Aquaculture Products, and Manufactured Food and Beverages are carried out by competent inspection bodies (IBs). The SAC-accredited IBs will be verified and recognised by the Singapore Food Agency under the purview of its Food Cargo Inspection Recognition Programme.

The accreditation for Food Cargo Inspection provides independent attestation on the competencies of inspection bodies to perform incoming and outgoing food cargo inspections for the transhipment, export and re-export to and from other economies. Accreditation ensures that the inspection activities are carried out by IBs are in accordance to the Standards (ISO 2859-1 Part 1: 1999, SS 629: 2017 and SS 668: 2020) which include additional accreditation requirements to ensure the traceability and non-manipulation of food cargo exported to and from other economies.
