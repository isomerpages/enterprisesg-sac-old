**SAC Launch of Instrumentation & Monitoring under the IB scheme**

The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to expand our Accreditation for Inspection Body Scheme to include Instrumentation & Monitoring (I&M) Works with effect from 1 July 2022.

The existing field under Site Investigation will be renamed as Site Investigation and Instrumentation & Monitoring to cater this new area of accreditation.

The new area of accreditation will provide assurance that the Instrumentation & Monitoring works are carried out by competent inspection bodies (IBs) and will be recognised by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) in their respective regime.

The accreditation for Instrumentation and Monitoring (I&M) aims to raise the competency and professionalism of I&M service providers (E.g. Geotechnical Borehole Instrumentation & Monitoring, Instrumentation & Monitoring for Struts). Accreditation ensures the inspection works are carrying out by IB are accordance to the Standards and enhances the safety of construction for Earth Retaining Stabilising Structures (ERSS) and tunnelling works. Tentatively from Jan 2024, BCA will require all BCA-registered specialist builders for I&M to be accredited by SAC as part of conditions for renewal of their licenses. 

Interested applicants will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17020 and respective SAC Technical Note : IM 01 â€“ Specific Requirements for the Accreditation of Inspection Bodies for Instrumentation & Monitoring under the Inspection scheme. 

Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC Accreditation portal, [SACINET website](https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}.
