SAC Assessor Enclave is a platform for SAC to express our appreciation to all our assessors. This year, the event was held on 4th October via Zoom and attended by over 100 participants, including SAC assessors, council committee and technical committee members.

Updates on SAC developments such as new programmes and the SAC’s APAC Peer Evaluation were shared at the event. There were two technical topics covered which were on Decision Rules applied for Laboratory Management Systems presented by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) and on Root Cause Analysis presented by Mr Poh Wei Jin from SAC. 

The event recognised 36 assessors who have contributed significantly to SAC’s assessments. SAC extends our heartiest congratulations to these assessors as well as our appreciation to all volunteers for their continued support and commitment to SAC. 

In addition, SAC also wishes to thank all volunteers for their support in SAC’s APAC Peer Evaluation in 2022.
