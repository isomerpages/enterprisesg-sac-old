**Launch of New Accreditation Programme for Facility Management under Management Systems Certification Body Scheme**


The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to announce the launch of our Accreditation Programme for Facility Management under Management Systems Certification Body Scheme with effect from 23 November 2023.
 
ISO 41001 Facility management — Management systems — Requirements with guidance for use is the world’s first management systems standard specifically for facility management (FM). ISO 41001 provides a flexible management framework that is intended to assist organisations to implement a FM system for effective and efficient delivery of FM operations and services in a sustainable manner to reduce costs and boost efficiency in a globally-competitive environment. 
 
In support of the national agenda to transform the FM sector to be future ready, the new accreditation programme adds value by providing an independent assessment on the FM certification process to ensure effective implementation of FM management system by FM organisations for their operations and services to the ISO 41001 standard.
 
CBs interested to be accredited by SAC will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17021-1, ISO/IEC TS 17021-11 and SAC document – CT 33 SAC Criteria for Certification Bodies (Facility Management System) under the accreditation scheme for Management System Certification Body.
 
Application for accreditation can be applied through the SAC accreditation portal, [SACiNet](https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/landing){:target="_blank}
