ISO/IEC 27001 is the leading international standard for information security management and helps organisations to keep information assets secure.  Accredited  ISO 27001 certification will provide confidence to organisations and stakeholders in areas related to cyber security and data protection. 
 
CBs to be accredited by SAC will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17021-1 and ISO/IEC 27006 Information technology security techniques – Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems. As part of the development of new programme for ISMS certification, SAC organised a training on ISO 27006 on 27-28 Sep 18 and the trainer was Ms Noriko Tominaga from ISMS Accreditation Center, Japan.
