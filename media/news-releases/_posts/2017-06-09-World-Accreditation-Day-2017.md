9 June 2017 marks World Accreditation Day, a global initiative established by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). This yearâ€™s theme focuses on how accreditation delivers confidence in construction and the built environment.
 
The Chairs of IAF and ILAC have released a [joint statement](http://ilac.org/?ddownload=120755){:target="_blank"} to share how accreditation can support those working in the sector including building owners, operators, contractors, manufacturers, designers, architects, and civil engineers. It also highlights how accreditation are used by policy makers, local authorities and regulators to support construction-based regulation, environmental protection, public safety, fraud prevention, public trust and innovation.

A [brochure](http://ilac.org/?ddownload=120762){:target="_blank"} has also been developed to include examples from around the world to demonstrate how accredited testing, inspection and certification is being used to provide suppliers, purchasers and specifiers with assurance that construction projects run efficiently, construction sites are safe and reliable materials are used.
