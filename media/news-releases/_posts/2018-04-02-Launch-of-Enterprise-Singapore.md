Our parent organisation - SPRING Singapore - has merged with another Singapore economic agency - International Enterprise (IE) Singapore - to form Enterprise Singapore, effective 2 April 2018. This move will channel increased resources to help Singapore companies develop capabilities and internationalise. In addition, Enterprise Singapore continues to be the lead agency for trade promotion, and remains the national body for standardisation and accreditation.

As Enterprise Singapore, we will work with a large base of companies who require differentiated support according to their stages of growth, the industries in which they operate, and their overseas markets of interest. Working with partners like yourself is now even more important as we reach out to this broad and diverse base of companies.

The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) will continue to be managed under Enterprise Singapore as the national authority for accreditation of conformity assessment bodies. In general, there is no change to SAC's operations and it will continue to function as normal before the merger.

With immediate effect, SAC secretariat's email addresses will be changed from XXX@spring.gov.sg to XXX@enterprisesg.gov.sg, with the front part ("XXX") of the email address unchanged. Our general SAC email address will now be <sac@enterprisesg.gov.sg>.

To build on the strong SAC identity, as well as draw stronger linkage to Enterprise Singapore, the SAC logo and its accreditation marks will be amended. More information regarding these changes will be released soon.

We look forward to working with all our partners and stakeholders under the new arrangements.
