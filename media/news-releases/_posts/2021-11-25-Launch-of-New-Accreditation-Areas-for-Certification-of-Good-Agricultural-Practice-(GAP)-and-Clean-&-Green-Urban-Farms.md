**Launch of New Accreditation Areas for Certification of Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) and Clean & Green Urban Farms**
 
In support of the national initiative for Singapore to be a leading food and agriculture technology hub, Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to expand our Accreditation Scheme for Product Certification to include certification of Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) and Clean & Green Urban Farms with effect from 25 November 2021.

The new accreditation areas will provide assurance that the certification of farms are carried out by competent certification bodies (CBs), to ensure quality assurance at source and a resilient supply of safe local vegetable produce, fish products and fresh poultry eggs through good agricultural practices, and sustainable production of quality, safe, clean and green product through use of resource-efficient technologies and practices by urban farms.
 

The certification is based on the following standards:

**GAP**<br />
SS 670 – Specification for good aquaculture practice,<br />
SS 675 – Specification for good agriculture practice, or<br />
SS 676 – Specification for good animal husbandry practice for layer farms
 
**Clean & Green Urban Farms**<br />
SS 661 – Specification for clean and green urban farms – Agriculture
 
CBs interested to be accredited by SAC for the 4 new scopes will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17065 and SAC document, CT 26 SAC Criteria for Certification Bodies (GAP and Clean & Green Urban Farms) under the accreditation scheme for product certification body.

Application for accreditation of GAP and Clean & Green Urban Farms certification is now open through the SAC accreditation portal, [SACiNet](https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg)
