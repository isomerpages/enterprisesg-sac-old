The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) has signed the Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (PAC) multilateral recognition arrangements (MLA) for accreditation of Energy Management Systems (EnMS) and Environmental Management Systems (EMS) on 25 March 2017. With the 2 new MLAs, SAC accredited EnMS (ISO 50001) and EMS (ISO 14001) certificates are recognized regionally.
 
Globally, there are growth in these 2 certifications. Based on the 2015 ISO survey, the number of ISO 14001 certificates issued increased by 8% to 319324 certificates and certification to ISO 50001 had doubled from the year 2014 to the year 2015 (from 6765 to 11985 certificates).  
 
The MLAs are important infrastructure to support international trade through removing technical barriers. The confidence and recognition of SAC accreditation will help to facilitate the acceptance of our products and services in overseas markets. With the new addition of the PAC MLA for EnMS and EMS, it allows users to make use of a regional network of certification bodies that have been accredited to provide reliable certification. Currently, SAC has accredited 5 EnMS certification bodies certification and 4 EMS certification bodies. The list of certification bodies can be found from SAC website.
