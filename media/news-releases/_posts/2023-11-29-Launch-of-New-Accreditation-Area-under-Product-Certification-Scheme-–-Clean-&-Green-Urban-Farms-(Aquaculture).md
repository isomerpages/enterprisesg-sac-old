**Launch of New Accreditation Area under Product Certification Scheme – Clean & Green Urban Farms (Aquaculture)**


In support of the SG Green Plan, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to announce the expansion of our Accreditation Scheme for Product Certification Scheme to include the area of Clean & Green Urban Farms (Aquaculture) with effect from 29 November 2023.
 
Clean & Green Urban Farms certification aims to strengthen Singapore’s food security towards a resilient future. In addition, the certification enables local farms to improve productivity, optimise resource utilisation and minimise waste generation, while at the same time ensuring food safety and quality through best industry practices. SS 689 – Specification for clean and green urban farms – Aquaculture sets requirements for the operation of sustainable aquaculture and provides guidance on best industry practices to ensure the quality and safety of products that are sustainably farmed. This standard caters to open cage, pond, tank, raceway and closed containment farming system for fish, crustaceans and molluscs in freshwater, brackish and marine environments through all phases of farm production. 
 
The new accreditation area supports the national initiative for Singapore to be a leading food and agriculture technology hub. With SAC accredited SS 689 certification, the certification of urban farms are carried out by competent certification bodies (CBs), to ensure quality assurance at source and a resilient supply of safe fish products through sustainable production of quality, safe, clean and green product through use of resource-efficient technologies and practices by urban farms.
 
CBs interested to be accredited by SAC for the above scope will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17065 and SAC document – CT 26 SAC Criteria for Certification Bodies (GAP and Clean & Green Urban Farms) under the accreditation scheme for Product Certification Body.
 
Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC accreditation portal, [SACiNet](https://sacinet2.enterprisesg.gov.sg/landing){:target="_blank}
