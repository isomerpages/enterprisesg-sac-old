This year, SPRING Singapore and SAC celebrates 50 years of the Singapore Standardisation Programme and 30 years of the Singapore Accreditation Programme.
 
Over the past 50 years, the Singapore's Quality and Standards (Q&S) initiative has played a critical role in our nation-building efforts and supported the development of key industries as well as contributed to the health and safety of our workers and the general public. It has built trust in Singapore’s products and services, thus enabling local enterprises to grow and access new markets.
 
In conjunction with the anniversary celebration, the Q&S Gala Dinner and Conference were held on 26 and 27 July 2016 at Resorts World Sentosa Convention Centre. The Gala Dinner was graced by Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, who envisioned quality and standards as a key pillar of the future economy.

More than 500 guests attended the gala dinner including foreign dignitaries, key government agencies, institutes of higher learning, trade associations, enterprises, accredited conformity assessment bodies, and partners of the standardisation and accreditation programmes.
 
A Special Recognition Awards Ceremony was also held on 26 July 2016 where mementos were given to Standards and Accreditation partners and accredited conformity assessment bodies who have made significant contributions in building Singapore’s Q&S infrastructure and journeyed with SAC for more than 25 years.
 
The conference was graced by Mr S Iswaran, Minister of Trade and Industry (Industry). This year's theme "Enabling Singapore's Future Economy" focuses on how Singapore organisations can seize opportunities and address challenges of technological quality and standards.
 
It brought together business leaders, subject matter experts and practitioners to share insights on how Singapore organisations can leverage quality and standards as a business strategy for growth, sustainability and internationalisation.
 
To commemorate the anniversaries, all the guests were given a commemorative book which showcases the roles of standards and accreditation in Singaporean’s everyday life.
