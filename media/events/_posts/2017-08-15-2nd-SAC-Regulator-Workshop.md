Efficient delivery of public service, building capabilities, increasing public confidence - these are some of the motivation for the participants who came to the Regulator Workshop organised by the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC). The event presents an opportunity for 38 representatives from 12 ministries and agencies to learn about how accreditation can support public policy, hear the experience of their peers and explore new means to work together more effectively through the whole-of-government approach.

Er. Lung Hian Hao, Director, Building & Construction Authority, shared on the collaborative journey between BCA and SAC in ensuring built safe and friendly built environment. "SAC accreditation plays an important complementary role in BCA's building regulations" said Er. Lung. He also touched on the importance of monitoring and improvements to ensure effective implementation.

Mr Md Elfian Harun, Assistant Director, Bunker Services, MPA shared on MPA's collaborative journey with various agencies including SAC to ensure transparent and efficient bunkering management to maintain Singaporeâ€™s position as a trusted bunkering hub.

The centrepiece of the event is the open dialogue where different agencies candidly shared on challenges they faced and areas where accreditation may help with their regulatory functions. In his closing remarks, Mr Renny Yeo, SAC Chairman thanked everyone for the collaborative spirit and called for collaboration to transform the challenges to opportunities where accreditation can come in to support the quality and standards of our enterprises.
