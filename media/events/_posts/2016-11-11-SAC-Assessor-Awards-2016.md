### SAC Assessor Awards 2016 - Recognising Assessors' Contributions
 
Assessors play a critical role in the maintenance of Singapore's accreditation infrastructure. Through their support, SAC has been able to build trust in the quality of Singapore's products and services.
 
To recognise the assessors' contributions, SAC has four categories of awards: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Distinguished which are given to assessors each year.
 
This year, the following 67 award recipients were recognised at the SAC Assessor Enclave held on 11 Nov 2016. We look forward to all the assessors' support in the years to come.
