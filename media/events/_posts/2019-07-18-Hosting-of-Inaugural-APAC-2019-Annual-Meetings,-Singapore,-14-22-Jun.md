The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) hosted the inaugural meetings in June 2019 with a participation of more than 120 senior representatives from over 60 accreditation bodies in the Asia-Pacific region. The annual meetings provided a common platform for the different accreditation bodies to discuss on policy matters, harmonise accreditation practices and more importantly, establish Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) for recognition of accredited reports. Ms Chang Kwei Fern, Director of SAC, has been elected as the Chair of APAC for a period of 2019 – 2021. 
 
In conjunction with the conference, SAC organised a seminar on "Accreditation – Adding Value to Supply Chains" to raise awareness and promote the value of accreditation and MRAs to local stakeholders. The seminar was graced by Guest of Honour, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry & Ministry of Education, Mr Chee Hong Tat. More than 200 local stakeholders, which include senior management from accredited conformity assessment bodies (TIC players), regulators, government agencies, trade associations and professional societies, attended the session.
