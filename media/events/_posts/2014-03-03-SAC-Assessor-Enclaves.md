SAC works on peer assessments of laboratories and inspection bodies where technical experts from industries, tertiary institutions or government bodies are often called upon to assist in the assessments.

### Experience Sharing for Chemical & Biological and Environmental Fields

On 8 November 2013, our volunteers and assessors from the Chemical & Biological and Environmental fraternities gathered for the annual enclave. SAC received an overwhelming response of 49 participants.

There were breakout sessions where assessors of similar expertise were grouped together to discuss and review the C&B and ENV Technical Notes.

The major outcomes for this enclave were achieved. These include the harmonization for categorization of common assessment findings and the networking and learning among the assessors. It was a half day well spent and the feedbacks were very positive with some assessors asking for more such sessions. The enclave was a success!

### Experience Sharing for Medical Testing and Medical Imaging Fields
With the publication of the revised ISO 15189 standard in November 2012, SAC took this opportunity to update the technical assessors in the Medical Testing and Medical Imaging Fields on the changes and new requirements of the standard on 12 September 2013.

The assessors were tasked to grade some of the common assessment findings and provide feedback on the challenges in the assessment of the new standard.  Throughout the session, there were candid sharing of experiences and understanding of the requirements. It was a fruitful session with positive feedback!

### Upcoming Experience Sharing for SAC External Lead Assessors and NDT Technical Assessors
The next Assessor Enclave scheduled on 25 March 2014 is for the SAC External Lead Assessors and NDT Technical Assessors. There will be sharings on the revised SAC documents and use of SACiNet. In addition, the lead assessors will also discuss and propose any revision needed for ISO/IEC 17025 while the NDT Technical assessors will discuss on the advanced NDT techniques as well as review the NDT Technical Notes.   

SAC looks forward to welcoming our assessors in the next enclave!
