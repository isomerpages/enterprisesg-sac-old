Following the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on 8 June 2019 for the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) to be Myanmar's Partner Accreditation Body, a knowledge sharing session was jointly organised with the Myanmarâ€™s Department of Research & Innovation (DRI) on 11 September 2017. SAC met up with prospective conformity assessment bodies in Yangon, Myanmar and shared on SAC accreditation programmes, its assessment process and criteria. There were a lot of interest in SAC as an internationally recognised accreditation body.

SAC also held a meeting with DRI to discuss the implementation of the MOU which include the joint assessment process, training needs, assessor qualification and promotion of accreditation to stakeholders. SAC also took the opportunity to visit two interested laboratories, the National Analytical Laboratory and the Myanmar Food & Drug Administration.
