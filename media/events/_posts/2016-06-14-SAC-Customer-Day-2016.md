In conjunction with the World Accreditation Day, the theme for this yearâ€™s SAC event is Accreditation: A Global Tool to Support Public Policy. We had invited Dr Llewellyn Richards, Chief Executive of IANZ, New Zealand to share with us his insights of the regulatory landscape and how global trends will affect the conformity assessment bodies.

One segment of the event was a discussion forum to engage the participants with various topics, including adoption of technologies for conformity assessment, strengthening the testing, inspection and certification (TIC) players to meet industry needs, and mandatory issuance of endorsed certificates and reports. The forum was interactive and the panellists shared their experiences on the topics and solicited views from our participants.

At the event, accreditation plaques were also presented to the SAC newly accredited conformity assessment bodies (CABs). SAC would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to the achievements of the following CABs.
