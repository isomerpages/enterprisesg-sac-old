## About Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC)

![our role](/images/about/our-role.jpg)

In Singapore, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is the national accreditation body. Managed by Enterprise Singapore, SAC maintains the integrity and impartiality of conformity assessment practices. The Council builds global trust in Singapore's products and services by strengthening our countryâ€™s technical infrastructure for conformity assessments, as well as forging Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) with our economic partners.  

SAC is represented by various interested parties from the industry, government, academia and Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs). It is supported by 5 Council Committees as well as 11 Technical Committees with over 500 committee members and assessors, each overseeing specific fields and areas of accreditation.

## What does SAC do?

SAC manages and promotes accreditation schemes and registration programmes by performing these functions.  

* Assessing and giving recognition to competent conformity assessment bodies
* Facilitating partnerships with government bodies and the industry on accreditation matters
* Establishing and maintaining an international network for the mutual recognition and acceptance of conformity assessment reports and certificates across national borders
* Raising awareness and encouraging the adoption of accredited Testing, Inspection & Certification (TIC) services through outreach efforts and regular engagement with government bodies and the industry.

As a pioneer member of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) of the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), reports and certificates issued by SAC-accredited laboratories are recognised worldwide by MRA members that span across  104 economies.
