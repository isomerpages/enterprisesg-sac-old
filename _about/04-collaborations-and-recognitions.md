### A Global Passport for Singapore Enterprises

To help businesses access global markets, SAC has signed several mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) which cover more than 90 economies. These MRAs are crucial in building confidence in the competency and capability of an international network of accredited CABs. 

They serve as a global passport for Singapore enterprises, help companies gain acceptance in overseas markets and reduce the need for re-testing, re-inspection or re-certification of their products upon entry into importing countries. The international recognition helps companies reduce unnecessary costs and time when entering foreign markets.
