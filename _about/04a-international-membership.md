Signatories to regional and international MRAs are subject to regular and stringent multi-national peer evaluations. The purpose is to verify signatoriesâ€™ continual conformance with the internationally accepted criteria. These peer evaluations ensure consistent accreditation practices and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the signatories.

SAC has developed a number of formal relationships with international/regional organisations. Some of them include [International Accreditation Forum (IAF)](https://www.iaf.nu/){:target="_blank"}, [Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC)](https://www.apac-accreditation.org/){:target="_blank"}, [International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC)](https://ilac.org/){:target="_blank"}, [ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ)](https://asean.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/){:target="_blank"}. SAC participates in various committees within these organisations and OECD GLP Working Group. In addition, SAC participates in relevant ISO/CASCO working groups.
