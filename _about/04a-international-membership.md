Signatories to regional and international MRAs are subject to regular and stringent multi-national peer evaluations. The purpose is to verify signatories’ continual conformance with the internationally accepted criteria. These peer evaluations ensure consistent accreditation practices and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the signatories.

SAC has developed a number of formal relationships with international/regional organisations. Some of them include [International Accreditation Forum (IAF)](https://www.iaf.nu/){:target="_blank"}, [Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC)](https://www.apac-accreditation.org/){:target="_blank"}, [International Laboratory Accreditation Co-operation (ILAC)](https://ilac.org/){:target="_blank"}, [ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ)](https://asean.org/asean-economic-community/sectoral-bodies-under-the-purview-of-aem/standards-and-conformance/){:target="_blank"} and [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/){:target="_blank"}. SAC participates in various committees within these organisations and OECD GLP Working Group. In addition, SAC participates in relevant ISO/CASCO working groups.
