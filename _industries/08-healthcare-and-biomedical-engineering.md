The healthcare value chain consists of several stakeholders involved in various activities that may be product or service-oriented. Products include equipment, pharmaceuticals, and complementary health products, while services in the sector are centered around provision of healthcare. In Singapore, the healthcare and biomedical industry is rapidly growing, with significant public investment in research aimed at driving productivity and innovation. This, along with the fourth industrial revolution, presents several new possibilities in the advancement of healthcare products and services. As a result, there are constantly new developments being made, generating greater need for conformity assessment.

Conformity assessment is an integral part of the industry due to the significance of public health and safety considerations. Testing laboratories, as well as inspection and certification bodies, offer a wide spectrum of services that cover all segments of the industry, from pharmaceuticals and equipment to healthcare facilities. Depending on the stage of production and position in the value chain, different services may be required. 

In the case of medical technology and complementary health products, for example, relevant conformity assessment services include safety tests and product validation, which ensure the safety of products. Good Laboratory Practice programmes and Quality Management Systems certification (e.g. ISO 13485) are additional options for supporting the validation of medical devices, which require particularly robust quality management and assurance in order to ensure consistency across different markets. 

Quality Management Systems apply to healthcare services and medical testing as well, with standards such as ISO 15189 used to assess compliance of medical laboratories to international requirements. ISO 9001 is commonly used by healthcare providers, though standards specific to the sector such as DIN EN 15224 (a European standard) are also available for businesses which wish to differentiate by demonstrating a higher level of healthcare quality.

SAC has accreditation schemes for laboratories as well as inspection and certification bodies, who in turn offer conformity assessment services including those outlined above, to support businesses in the healthcare and biomedical industry by providing added credibility and assurance.

In Singapore, the Health Sciences Authority is the regulatory body governing the healthcare and biomedical industry, and it lays out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.
