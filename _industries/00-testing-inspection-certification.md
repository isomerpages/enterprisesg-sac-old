The Testing, Inspection and Certification (TIC) sector ensures the safety, integrity and quality of goods and services across different end industries through conformity assessment and assurance. The key roles of TIC are to provide conformity assessment for operational efficacy, catalyse R&D and innovation in emerging areas through verification and validation, establish mutual recognition to facilitate market access and provide quality assurance and trust of Singaporeâ€™s products and services. It is a key component in the national Standards & Conformance infrastructure supporting across industries and enterprise value chains.
