Singapore's infrastructure sector includes both real estate and built environment industries. Total construction demand in the country  amounted to about $30.5 billion in 2018.

Emerging technologies now enable shorter construction times and the development of innovative building methods; these are driving the growth of a "smart city", powered by data and online connectivity. Singapore's Smart Nation initiative is also gaining traction, with the development of a physical infrastructure that can support smart city technologies, as well as physical devices that are connected to IoT (Internet of Things) networks.

However, safety remains a key consideration, especially in light of the growing need for faster and more cost-effective construction.

Conformity assessment can provide assurance over quality and safety in this sector. Accreditation ensures that developments in construction methods – and any materials used - are not at the expense of public safety. Accreditation also raises market appeal by providing greater customer confidence at every stage of construction. 

SAC-accredited conformity assessment bodies (CABs) provide a variety of testing, inspection, and certification services relevant to the industry at each stage of a building's life cycle.

At the construction stage, CABs can provide laboratory testing and certification for construction materials (e.g. polymers, ready-mixed concrete), and conduct inspections on structural steelwork and lifting equipment. Firms in the construction industry often also seek certification for Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP), fire, and security systems. Construction firms with sustainability initiatives can also seek accreditation for management systems, such as for the implementation of eco-friendly or low-cost energy-saving projects.

Tests are also often needed after initial construction to validate functionality and safety. Towards the end of a building's life cycle, retrofits may be necessary, and certification bodies are able to ascertain the safety of devices such as modified lifting equipment.

In Singapore, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is the regulatory body governing the construction industry, and it lays out specific requirements with regard to conformity assessment.
