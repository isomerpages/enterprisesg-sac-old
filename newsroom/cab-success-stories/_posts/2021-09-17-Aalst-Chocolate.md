Microblog post on Aalst Chocolate:
Going round the world – with chocolates.
Singapore isn’t the first name to pop up when it comes to confectionary. But Singapore-based Aalst Chocolate is today the leading chocolate manufacturer in Asia with six brands under its wing and exporting to 45 countries globally.
Their winning recipe?
The pursuit of perfection and emphasis on quality through the adoption of standards and accreditation.

Only the highest quality ingredients are used and every batch undergoes rigorous testing for safety, taste, and consistency. Being in the competitive business of food, upholding the right standards earns them consumer trust coupled with competitive advantage. 
With bizSAFE Level 4, ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and SS 590 certifications under their belt, their customers have peace of mind when it comes to their products. Having Singapore Accreditation Council’s accredited certifications in their quality management systems also provided added assurance that Aalst Chocolate implements proper quality and food safety management systems and processes. It has also enabled this company to access crucial international markets, shifting beyond cutting cost to creating value – a sweet and assured way to keep growing.
