**SAC Assessor Enclave 2021** 

SAC Assessor Enclave is a platform for SAC to express our appreciation to all our assessors. This year, the event was virtually held on 5th October and attended by over 100 participants, including SAC assessors, council committee and technical committee members.

Updates on new developments such as the SACiNet 2.0 platform and revamped SAC Knowledge Centre were shared at the event. The new SACiNet 2.0 would improve user experiences and management of assessments online, providing timely updates for all in the value chain. The revamped SAC Knowledge Centre will enable assessors to access on-demand training syllabuses and materials. Our guest speaker from the National Metrology Centre, Dr Meng Yusong, shared on Metrological Traceability of Measurement Results, as part of effort to align understanding and assessment practices.

The event recognised 53 assessors who have contributed significantly to SACâ€™s assessment. As we give our heartiest congratulations to these assessors, we would also like to extend our appreciation to all assessors for their continued support and commitment to SAC, especially for their support of new initiatives in the SAC Strategic Plan 2025.
