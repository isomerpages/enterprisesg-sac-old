**Launch of New Accreditation Programme for Cold Chain Management System Certification**

Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is pleased to launch the new accreditation programme for Cold Chain Management System (CCMS) Certification on 16 November 2021. 

This new accreditation programme accredits certification bodies (CBs) certifying companies to SS 668: Part 1: 2020 Cold chain management of chilled and frozen foods – Part 1: General requirements. SS 668 is intended to strengthen Singapore’s cold chain ecosystem, by setting out the general requirements for the management of chilled and frozen food, including pre-packaged food, meat, vegetables and fruits, fish, as well as chilled table eggs. The accreditation programme will ensure that the certification of the cold chain management systems are carried out by competent CBs, so that consumers can be assured of the quality of chilled and frozen food products in the market.

CBs interested to be accredited by SAC for this programme will be assessed based on ISO/IEC 17021-1 and SAC document, CT 25: SAC Criteria for Certification Bodies (Cold Chain Management System) under the accreditation scheme for management systems certification body.

Application for accreditation of CCMS certification is now open through the SAC accreditation portal, [SACiNet]
