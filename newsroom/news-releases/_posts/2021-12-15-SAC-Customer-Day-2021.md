**Singapore Accreditation Council Customer Day 2021**

The SAC Customer Day 2021 was held on 16 November 2021. The theme for this year’s event was “Unlock a Green Future Through Accreditation” with the objective to raise awareness and uncover the business opportunities in the sustainability sector. Due to the COVID-19 situation, it was a hybrid event attended by more than 210 participants which included SAC accredited conformity assessment bodies (CABs), SAC partners and volunteers.

The highlight for this year event was an interactive panel presentation which shared insightful views and exchanges on how standards and accreditation can support the Singapore Green Plan and other environmental sustainability initiatives.
