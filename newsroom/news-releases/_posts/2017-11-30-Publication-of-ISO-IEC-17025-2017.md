The new version of ISO/IEC 17025, the international standard for testing and calibration laboratories, was published on 30 November 2017, and has been adopted as a Singapore Standard. A copy of this standard is available for purchase at [Toppan Leefung Pte Ltd](https://www.singaporestandardseshop.sg/){:target="_blank"}. Accredited laboratories are encouraged to purchase a copy to understand the changes and opt for an early transition to this revised standard.

### SAC's Transition Policy

The Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) has adopted ILAC's recommendation to give accredited laboratories a **3-year transition period**. Laboratories who are not accredited to ISO/IEC 17025: 2017 standard after 29 November 2020 will not be allowed to issue SAC-accredited reports or certificates.

* With effect from 1 April 2018, assessment for applicant laboratories will be based on ISO/IEC 17025: 2017.

* With effect from 1 April 2019, all assessments for existing accredited laboratories shall be based on ISO/IEC 17025: 2017.

* SAC will issue a new Certificate of Accreditation to the laboratory upon successful transition.

* Laboratories who are not accredited to ISO/IEC 17025: 2017 by **29 November 2020** will not be allowed to issue accredited reports and certificates, and will be suspended by SAC.

Please contact your SAC Account Manager for further information on the transition arrangements.
