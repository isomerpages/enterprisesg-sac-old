We are aware of a fake website that is phishing for personal identification numbers. This website uses several government-related logos, including that of the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC), to encourage visitors to provide personal details to verify certificates and training details. This is an illegitimate website. As the SAC is overseen by Enterprise Singapore, our website includes “gov.sg” in the web address. Please do not provide any personal information to unauthorised parties.
