SAC is pleased to expand our Product Certification Scheme to include certification of Structural Steelwork Fabricators on 2 November 2018.

SAC CT 20 _SAC Criteria for Certification Bodies (Structural Steelworks Fabricators)_ specifies the additional definitions and supplementary criteria for certification bodies (CBs) of structural steelworks fabricators and is to be used with ISO/IEC 17065 and the applicable IAF Mandatory Documents.  CBs shall assess and certify the Factory Production Control system of structural steelworks fabricators according to the following standards:

* SS EN 1090-1:2018 – _Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures – Part 1: Requirements for conformity assessment of structural components_
* SS EN 1090-2:2018 – _Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures – Part 2: Technical requirements for steel structures_

The SS EN 1090-1:2018 and SS EN 1090-2: 2018 have been published in October 2018. SS EN 1090-2: 2018 is an identical adoption of EN 1090-2:2008+A1:2011 and with additional BC-1 material incorporated in the form of a National Foreword. BC1:2012 Design Guide on Use of Alternative Steel to BS 5950 and Eurocode 3 is issued by the Building and Construction Authority of Singapore (BCA).

The requirement to use SAC accredited certification body (CB) for evaluation of conformity and issue Factory Production Control (FPC) certificates to structural steelworks fabricators is clearly stated in the National Forward of SS EN 1090-1:2018. The Singapore's Structural Design Codes have fully adopted the Eurocodes since April 2015.  Through accredited certification, BCA aims to align the local fabrication practices with the Eurocodes and raise the competency and professionalism of structural steelworks fabricators. 

Application for accreditation is now open through the SAC accreditation portal, [SACiNet](https://sacinet.enterprisesg.gov.sg/sac/forms/sacinet/sacinet-logon-external.form){:target="_blank"}.  Please contact your account manager for more information.
