*Dr James Galloway, CEO, JAS-ANZ, sharing on Conformance for Future of Manufacturing*

The Quality and Standards Conference 2014 (QS2014) was held on 5 August 2014 at Orchard Hotel, with the theme "Quality and Standards for the Future of Manufacturing in Singapore". The event showcases how standards and conformance play a key role in supporting advanced manufacturing technologies, such as additive manufacturing, re-manufacturing and robotics, and in helping the manufacturers of the manufacturing and engineering industries gain competitive advantage through increased productivity.
 
Dr James Galloway, Chief Executive Officer of The Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand (JAS-ANZ), was one of the speakers at the Conference. He gave an insightful presentation on the Conformance for Future of Manufacturing.
 
At the event, SAC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with JAS-ANZ on closer cooperation in accreditation activities. The cooperation includes the accreditation of certification bodies; training and exchange of personnel; process benchmarking and improvement; promotion of accreditation; and joint initiatives at regional and international fora.
 
Another MoU was signed at the event between SAC and Singapore Polytechnic (SP). This collaboration is to educate and strengthen the quality mindset in the Singapore workforce, and it includes the design of a Diploma Course in Applied Sciences to raise the competence level of working adults in laboratory management.
 
A new accreditation scheme was developed for learning service provider certification to support the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in improving the quality of the learning service providers. ISO/IEC 17021:2011 will be used for accrediting certification bodies and ISO 29990:2010 will be used to certify them.
 
This event was also to recognise the contribution of SAC partners who have contributed to strengthening Singapore's Quality and Standards infrastructure and to present awards to SAC newly accredited conformity assessment bodies. Congratulations to all our award recipients!
