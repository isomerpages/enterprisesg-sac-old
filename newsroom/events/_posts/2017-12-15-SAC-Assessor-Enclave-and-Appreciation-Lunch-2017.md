SAC organised its annual Assessor Enclave on 15 November 2017 to discuss technical issues, harmonise assessment practices and provide networking opportunities for fellow assessors. The event was attended by about 110 assessors and committee members from the laboratory and inspection body accreditation schemes.

SAC shared on the recently revised key international standards ISO/IEC 17011 and 17025, as well as changes in accreditation processes, such as the SACiNet Tech Refresh and E-Invoicing system.

The subsequent breakout sessions for laboratory and inspection body assessors provided a platform for in-depth discussion and clarification on some of the key requirements in the revised standards and the classification of non-conformities in their specific areas.

SAC also took the opportunity to recognise our assessors’ contribution and support for our various accreditation programmes. 53 assessors received their awards during the event. We look forward to all the assessors' support in the years to come.
