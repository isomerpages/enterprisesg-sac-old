Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) organised a Regulator Workshop on 9 June 2016 at Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre. This workshop was organised in conjunction with the World Accreditation Day (WAD), with the theme Accreditation - A Global Tool to Support Public Policy. The workshop served as a platform for the various regulatory bodies to share experiences and clarify doubts on the use of accreditation in their regulatory regime. The event was attended by more than 50 participants representing 18 ministries and agencies.

SAC invited Dr Llewellyn Richards, Chief Executive, International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) to share with the regulators on the effective use of accreditation to support regulatory work in New Zealand. There were also presentations from SPRING Singapore, Health Science Authority and Ministry of Manpower on how accreditation serves as an important tool to support policy and regulation.

At the open dialogue session, positive feedback, improvement and clarification areas were solicited from the participants. Key areas of discussion include the access to expertise by SAC, the training and qualifications of assessors, the assessment process and the values versus the cost of accreditation.
