The inaugural SAC Customer Day was held on 13 August 2015 at Singapore EXPO Max Atria. The highly anticipated event registered a turnout of about 200 key stakeholders from conformity assessment bodies (CABs), regulators, associations, professional bodies, Standards and Accreditation partners. The key objectives of the event were to share on the opportunities and challenges for expanding to regional markets; results from the Testing & Certification landscape study; regulatory use of accredited services; and most importantly for SAC leaders to engage our customers and stakeholders to discuss issues related to branding, raising awareness and use  of accredited services, new capability needs and supporting them going overseas.

The highlight of the event was the stakeholder engagement session where the participants were very candid and open in sharing experiences and providing suggestions. Overall there was much positive assurance in the areas where SAC has done well and also willingness of CABs to collaborate with SAC to promote the value of SAC accreditation and mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) locally and internationally.
