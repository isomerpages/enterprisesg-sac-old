The SAC Assessor Enclave was held virtually on 5 November 2020 to highlight SACâ€™s achievements, update new developments in accreditation and share best practices with SAC assessors. During the event, we presented SAC assessors with e-certificates to recognise their invaluable contributions to the various accreditation programmes. We extend our appreciation to all assessors for their continued support and commitment.
