SAC is the national accreditation body in Singapore. It operates a range of accreditation programmes that provide independent assessment and formal recognition of the competence of companies in performing specific types of testing, calibration, inspection, certification and other related activities.

The accreditation criteria for determining the competence of companies are based on the relevant international standard (eg. ISO/IEC 17025, ISO 15189, ISO/IEC 17020, ISO/IEC 17021-1, ISO/IEC 17024, ISO/IEC 17065, ISO/IEC 17043).

* [Laboratories](laboratories) 
* [Inspection Bodies](inspection-bodies)

We also administer the [Singapore Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance Programme](/services/accreditation-services/glp-compliance-monitoring).

We organise accreditation-related training courses such as scheme-specific conformity requirements, technical and management skillsets as well as updates on international requirements.
