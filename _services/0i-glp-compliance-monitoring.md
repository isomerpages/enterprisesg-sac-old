![Good Laboratory Practive Compliance Programme](/images/services/glp-accreditation-services.jpg)

Enterprise Singapore (formerly known as SPRING Singapore) was appointed by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) in 2007 to be the Singapore GLP Monitoring Authority. SAC was entrusted with the task of managing the GLP Compliance Monitoring programme in 2012.

The Singapore Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance Programme was launched in November 2007 to recognise facilities which provide non-clinical safety testing in accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles of Good Laboratory Practice.

The programme ensures that a facility’s processes and the conditions in which laboratory studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived meet international requirements. It enables Singapore enterprises' research laboratories to gain acceptance for their environmental health and safety data in OECD countries. This reduces duplicative testing and thus shortens the time-to-market for their new products.

Singapore has been a member of the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) framework since January 2010. Studies conducted in Singapore under GLP compliant conditions are accepted in more than 30 OECD and non-OECD member countries.
