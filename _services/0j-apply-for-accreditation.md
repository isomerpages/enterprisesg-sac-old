## Who can Apply?
The SAC accreditation schemes are open to all conformity assessment bodies (CABs) such as laboratories, inspection and certification bodies.

## How to Get Accredited?

It can take between three to six months for organisations to obtain their SAC accreditation. This is dependent on a number of factors, such as the degree of the organisation's compliance with requirements, the complexity of scope of accreditation and the availability of witnessing and clearance of incidences of non-conformance highlighted during the assessment. The SAC application process covers:

#### 1. Basic Requirements
To apply for SAC accreditation, a CAB must first provide evidence of fulfilling the base requirements outlined in the relevant standards. ISO/IEC 17020, 17021, 17024, 17025, 17043, 17065 and ISO 15189. It must also be a registered legal entity. SAC documents pertaining to the different schemes can be accessed [here](/resources/publications).

#### 2. Access to Application Form
Upon fulfilling the basic requirements, the CAB can apply online through the [SACINET website](https://sacinet.enterprisesg.gov.sg/sac/forms/sacinet/sacinet-logon-external.form){:target="_blank"}.
