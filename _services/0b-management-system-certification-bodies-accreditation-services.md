## About

Accreditation is an endorsement of a certification body's independence, integrity and technical competence. Most importantly, accreditation provides a certification body with a trust mark and confidence to offer its services nationally and globally.

### About the Scheme

The scheme was extended in August 2003 to cover the certification of bunker suppliers, in a show of support for the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore's initiative to highlight Singapore's status as a bunkering hub. In April 2008, the scheme was further extended to cover the certification of good distribution practice of medical devices (GDPMDS). This was an effort to support the Health Sciences Authority's initiative to ensure the quality and integrity of medical devices throughout the distribution process.
 
The Accreditation Scheme for Environmental Management System Certification Bodies was launched in November 1999.

In July 2005, the Accreditation Scheme for Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Management System was launched, followed by the Accreditation Scheme for HACCP based Food Management System in September 2005.

### Accreditation Criteria

SAC accredits certification bodies that can demonstrate compliance with the requirements and scope stated in SAC CT 01.


### Benefits
Accreditation will:

* **Increase confidence**:  
Widely recognised by regulators and the industry, SAC accredited certificates instil greater confidence in those who choose to engage the services of SAC accredited certification bodies. 

* **International recognition**:  
As a member of the Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) for Quality Management System of both the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), certificates issued by SAC accredited certification bodies are recognised worldwide by MLA members across more than 50 economies.

### Process
Upon receiving the application for accreditation, qualified assessors are assigned to assess the system of operations of the certification body and the competence of the auditors. This will be carried out through a document review, assessments at the certification body's office as well as on-site witnessed assessments of audits â€“ all conducted by the certification body. When the certification body has demonstrated compliance with our requirements, it will be recommended for accreditation. Once approved, SAC will grant a certificate of accreditation. The detailed description of the type of assessment is stipulated in CT 01, Accreditation Process.
