### Benefits
Accreditation will:

Increase confidence:
*  Provide assurance to employers, industries and the general public on the competence of certified individuals. Endorse that professionals have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties well.

International recognition:
*  As a member of the Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) for Personnel Certification of both the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), certificates issued by SAC accredited personnel certification bodies are recognised worldwide by MLA members across more than 50 economies.


### Process
The accreditation process involves an onsite assessment to validate if the CB operating a PC programme is competent and meets the globally accepted benchmark for personnel certification. After the initial award of accreditation, there will be surveillance
visits to ensure continual compliance to the SAC accreditation requirements.

The scheme requires Personnel CBs to follow a systematic and impartial approach in the assessment of the competence of professionals such as welders, medical technologists, NDT personnel, financial planners and business consultants.

This accreditation scheme will provide a transparent system for assessment and recognition of competence and qualifications of workers, which is needed to support the workforce development efforts of the public and private sectors.
