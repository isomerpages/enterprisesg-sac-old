## The Scheme

The Accreditation Scheme for Auditing Organisations (AOs) was launched in 2017. It is one of the accreditation schemes under the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) which is managed by Enterprise Singapore.

The primary objectives of Auditing Organisations Scheme are to

* provide by means of assessment, the assurance that the professional practice by auditing organisations are in accordance with relevant criteria such as CT 17, regulatory requirements and relevant SAC documents;
* ensure that the auditing processes are carried out with professionalism and integrity;
* build the capabilities of auditing organisations and auditors to meet regulatory requirements.

The Auditing Organisation Scheme gives formal recognition to auditing organisations that have been independently assessed and found to comply with the criteria established by SAC. Accreditation is granted for the scopes applied, and is not a blanket approval for its total operations.


## Accreditation Criteria

SAC accredits auditing organisations that can demonstrate compliance with the requirements listed in SAC CT 17.

## Application Process

All applications shall be made through SACiNet (online platform for accreditation process) and are to be supported with documents containing sufficient information regarding its staff, management system, or other information necessary or requested by SAC from time to time for the assessment of the auditing organisation. Upon receipt of a duly completed application and satisfactory supporting documents relating to its management system, an acknowledgement notification will be sent to the applicant through SACiNet. A quotation for the document review, preliminary assessment (if requested) and initial assessment, shall be sent to the applicant for agreement either through SACiNet or email. 

The CCC grants accreditation to the applicant upon verifying that the auditing organisation meets the criteria for accreditation. The detailed description of the type of assessment is stipulated in CT 01A, Accreditation Process.
