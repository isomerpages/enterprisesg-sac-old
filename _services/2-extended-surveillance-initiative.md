**Extended Surveillance Initiative**

The Extended Surveillance Initiative is open to all Laboratories (except medical testing and medical imaging laboratories), Inspection Bodies and Proficiency Testing Providers. CABs who have been evaluated and found to have met the requirements for this initiative will have their surveillance assessments carried out at intervals of 1.5 years instead of annually.

1.  Eligibility Criteria

    There should be no outstanding payments owed to SAC/ESG.

    The CAB should not have any valid / legitimate complaints or blacklisted by any government agency in the past 4 years. It should
    also not be served warning letter by SAC/ESG or have its accreditation suspended or withdrawn in the last 4 years.



2.  Qualification Criteria

    SAC would expect the CAB to have consistently performed well in both QMS and technical aspects and possess a good attitude towards
    improving its own system and a robust risk analysis. In addition, there should be adherence to the proper use of SAC Mark and
    timely submission of corrective actions (30 days).
